                Through <strong>Ride For The Roses</strong>, I’m raising money for the <strong>KWF Cancer Foundation</strong>.
                Before participating in the Ride For The Roses event, I will embark on a longer, personal journey:
                cycling from Jávea, Spain, to Delft, Netherlands.

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>
                I felt the need to do something for charity after my mother passed away due to cancer. In those moments, I felt an immense sense of hopelessness and loss. During this time, I gained support from friends and family around me, which made me experience extreme gratitude for their kindness and support.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want to share this kindness, love, and gratitude, not only because of how I experienced it during difficult times, but also because of how I was raised by my mother. She embodied these important values and shared them with the world. I owe it to her to do the same, to share that part of me that is also hers and carry forward a part of her spirit.
            </p>
            <p>
                For years, I held onto the idea of doing something meaningful, but nothing felt quite right, until I discovered cycling. Cycling felt like meditation when following a constant rhythm, while at other times it allowed me to push myself to my limit.
            </p>
            <p>
                During my travels, I hope to achieve both: to feel that calmness and go inward to experience and share the true core values, but also to push myself and do things I have never done before, for a good cause.
            </p>

            <h2>The Symbolism</h2>
            <p>
                My journey will start in Jávea, Spain, the place where I was fortunate enough to have spent most of my life with my family during both beautiful and difficult moments. It is also the place where my mother is laid to rest — a beautiful place to start this transformative journey.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once I arrive in Delft, Netherlands, I will rest briefly before taking part in Ride For The Roses. The symbolism is deeply personal: every time we visit my mother’s grave, we place four roses, one for each of us. The event happens just after my journey ends, and on my birthday — it felt like more than coincidence.

        <section class="support">
            <h2>Support the Cause</h2>
            <p>
                The Ride For The Roses supports the <strong>KWF</strong>, which funds cancer research and supports people living with the disease in direct and meaningful ways.
            </p>
            <p>
